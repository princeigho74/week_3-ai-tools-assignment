## 🔍 Part 1: Theoretical Understanding

### TensorFlow vs PyTorch Comparison

| Aspect | TensorFlow | PyTorch |
|--------|-----------|---------|
| Computation Graph | Static (TF 2.x: dynamic) | Dynamic (define-by-run) |
| Learning Curve | Steeper | Gentle, Pythonic |
| Production Support | Excellent | Growing |
| Research Use | Good | Excellent |
| Deployment Tools | Comprehensive | Basic |

### Framework Recommendations

**Use TensorFlow when:**
- Building production systems at scale
- Deploying to mobile/edge devices
- Working with existing TF infrastructure
- Needing comprehensive deployment tools

**Use PyTorch when:**
- Conducting research
- Prototyping quickly
- Building custom architectures
- Prioritizing code clarity

## 🛠️ Part 3: Ethics & Optimization

### Identified Biases in MNIST

1. **Distribution Bias:** Slight class imbalance (1.24x ratio)
2. **Representation Bias:** Limited to US postal service data
3. **Demographic Bias:** Single demographic source
4. **Temporal Bias:** Data from 1990s

### Mitigation Strategies

✓ Data augmentation (rotation, scaling, elastic deformation)  
✓ Stratified cross-validation  
✓ Multiple dataset sources (EMNIST, IAM, Chars74K)  
✓ Per-class fairness monitoring  
✓ TensorFlow Fairness Indicators  

### Common Bugs Fixed

| Bug | Error | Fix |
|-----|-------|-----|
| Wrong input shape | ValueError on layer input | Flatten images first |
| Wrong activation | Poor convergence | Use softmax for multi-class |
| Loss-target mismatch | Shape incompatibility | Match loss to label format |
| Dimension mismatch | Input shape error | Reshape/flatten data |
